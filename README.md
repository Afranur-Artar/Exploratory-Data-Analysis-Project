# Exploratory Data Analysis

A typical data science project starts with exploring the data. Exploratory data analysis is the first building block of the data science pipeline. Before moving on to the modeling phase, we need to fully understand the data we work with. The better we understand our data, the more useful we can identify and extract the most useful features, which boost the performance of the model.
